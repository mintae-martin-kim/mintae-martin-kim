## Current Position
- **Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering at Hybrid Robotics Lab, UC Berkeley**
- I am a Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering at Hybrid Robotics Lab, University of California, Berkeley, being advised by Prof. Koushil Sreenath. Currently I am collaborating with Silicon Synapse Lab at Northeastern University. My minors are Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. I am focusing on application of machine learning and optimization to Robot Intelligence and Dynamical Systems (RIDS). My interest spans multiple areas, including control of dynamical systems, learning-based robust motion control and planning, and biomimicry. Ultimate goal of my research is to build systems and industries that contribute to sustainable development of mankind. Academically, I pursue physical intuition based on deep and rigorous mathematical reasoning, and I call this "Deepveloping".
